# Getting Started

:::danger Draft Content

This page needs to be converted from a draft to real instructions.

Guides should be step-by-step instructions. Devs use them to complete a task.
Doing, not learning. If you want to explain why, add notes to pages under "The
Basics" (or add a new page there).

:::

This page should be a run-through of using the
[`rnx-init`](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/issues/1263) command, but it
hasn't been built yet. In the mean time, walk the reader through the manual
steps that `rnx-init` will automate.

Start with dep-check init. This sets up a basic config and configures the
dependency manager.

For App packages, create or update Metro/Babel config files. Metro:
@rnx-kit/metro-config, @rnx-kit/metro-resolver-symlinks. Babel:
@rnx-kit/babel-preset-metro-react-native.
