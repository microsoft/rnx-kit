# Getting Started

Welcome! A good place to start with any React Native project is the dependency
manager. It keeps your React Native dependencies up-to-date and healthy using
automation which ties into your developer workflows.

This guide gets you off and running with the dependency manager. To begin,
choose a package that uses React Native and open a terminal window.

:::tip

If you want to learn more about this project before jumping in, head to the
[introduction](/docs/introduction) page.

:::

Start by adding the dependency manager to your package.

<PackageCommand
  yarnArgs="add @rnx-kit/align-deps --dev"
  pnpmArgs="add -D @rnx-kit/align-deps"
  npmArgs="add --save-dev @rnx-kit/align-deps"
/>

Next, generate the dependency manager configuration for your package. If your
package produces a bundle, it's an `app`. Otherwise, it's a `library`.

<AlignDepsInit />

Fix any React Native package versions that might have compatibility issues.

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-align-deps --write" />

Review the changes. They should be limited to package.json and your Yarn / npm /
pnpm lock file.

:::info Test Your Package

If any dependency versions changed, test your package to be sure everything is
still in working order.

:::

Congratulations! You can now automatically maintain your package as the React
Native ecosystem grows and changes. Take a look at the
[dependency management](/docs/guides/dependency-management) guide to learn how.
