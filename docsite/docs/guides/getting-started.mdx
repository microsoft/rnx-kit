# Getting Started

Welcome! To get started, choose a package that uses React Native and open a
terminal window. This guide walks you through configuring your package to use
the dependency manager, which helps you keep your React Native dependencies
up-to-date and compatible with each other. It's simple, it's automated, and it's
(usually) painless.

:::tip

If you want to learn more about this project before jumping in, head to the
[introduction](/docs/introduction) page.

:::

Add the dependency manager to your package.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn add @rnx-kit/dep-check --dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npm add --save-dev @rnx-kit/dep-check
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Initialize your package's dependency manager configuration. If your package
produces a bundle, it's an application. Otherwise, it's a library.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --init app
```

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --init library
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --init app
```

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --init library
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Adjust any React Native dependencies that might have compatibility issues.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --write
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --write
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Review the changes. They should be limited to package.json and your Yarn / npm lock file.

:::info Trust, But Verify

If any React Native dependency versions were changed, test your package to be sure
everything is still in working order.

:::

Congratulations! You can now automatically maintain your package as the React Native
ecosystem grows and changes. Take a look at the
[dependency management](/docs/guides/dependency-management) guide to learn how.
