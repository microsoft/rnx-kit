# Getting Started

Welcome! A good place to start with any React Native package is the dependency
manager. It keeps your React Native dependencies up-to-date and healthy using
**automation** that ties into your developer workflows.

This guide gets you off an running with the dependency manager. Choose a
package that uses React Native and open a terminal window to begin.

:::tip

If you want to learn more about this project before jumping in, head to the
[introduction](/docs/introduction) page.

:::

First, add the dependency manager to your package.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn add @rnx-kit/dep-check --dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npm add --save-dev @rnx-kit/dep-check
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, create a dependency manager configuration for your package. If your package
produces a bundle, it's an `app`. Otherwise, it's a `library`.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --init app
```

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --init library
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --init app
```

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --init library
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Adjust any React Native dependencies that might have compatibility issues.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```sh
yarn rnx-dep-check --write
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npx rnx-dep-check --write
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Review the changes. They should be limited to package.json and your Yarn / npm lock file.

:::info Trust, But Verify

If any React Native dependency versions were changed, test your package to be sure
everything is still in working order.

:::

Congratulations! You can now automatically maintain your package as the React Native
ecosystem grows and changes. Take a look at the
[dependency management](/docs/guides/dependency-management) guide to learn how.
