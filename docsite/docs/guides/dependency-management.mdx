# Dependency Management

Ready for some magic? This guide will fundamentally change the way you maintain
your React Native applications and libraries. It all centers on one tool -- the
dependency manager.

[dependencies](/docs/dependencies) first.

:::

## Onboarding

The first order of business is onboarding your React Native packages to the
dependency manager. Do this for every React Native package you have. It can be
done all at once, or gradually over multiple PRs.

First, add the dependency manager to your package.

<PackageCommand
  yarnArgs="add @rnx-kit/dep-check --dev"
  pnpmArgs="add -D @rnx-kit/dep-check"
  npmArgs="add --save-dev @rnx-kit/dep-check"
/>

Add new script commands for convenience. We'll use these later.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "check-dependencies": "rnx-dep-check",
    "fix-dependencies": "rnx-dep-check --write"
  }
}
```

Next, generate the dependency manager configuration for your package. If your
package produces a bundle, it's an `app`. Otherwise, it's a `library`.

<DepCheckInit />

Fix any React Native package versions that might have compatibility issues.

<PackageRunCommand args="fix-dependencies" />

**Review** and **test** your changes before committing. This is important, even
for seemingly harmless updates.

## Automating Everything

Once onboarding is done, you're ready to set up automation.

Automation validates your React Native dependencies during builds and PRs. It
also keeps the dependency manager up-to-date, including the built-in list of
known/good React Native package versions and releases. This list can change
frequently, based on the volatility of the React Native ecosystem.

### Builds

To validate dependencies during a build, you'll integrate the
`check-dependencies` command into your build workflow.

In each of your React Native packages, add it to the `build` command:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "... existing-stuff ... && yarn fix-dependencies"
  }
}
```

_Replace `yarn` with `npm run` or `pnpm`, depending on your package manager._

When the validation process finds a compatibility problem, it fails with a
detailed message, showing you what went wrong before you commit to the repo.

:::tip Using a Task Runner?

If you're using a task runner like [Lage](https://microsoft.github.io/lage) or
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com), you can go for a more sophisticated integration. The
advantage being that `fix-dependencies` could run in its own "step" with
isolated logging and error handling. And, you can run it in parallel with other
tasks.

:::

### Pull Requests

To validate dependencies during PRs, you'll use the dependency manager to check
every package in your repo.

Add the dependency manager to your repo's root package.json.

<PackageCommand
  yarnArgs="add @rnx-kit/dep-check --dev -W"
  pnpmArgs="add -D @rnx-kit/dep-check"
  npmArgs="add --save-dev @rnx-kit/dep-check"
/>

Next, add this command to your PR loop. It runs the dependency manager from the
root of the repo, scanning all packages. This include packages which haven't
onboarded yet. For those, `--vigilant [version]` controls the target React
Native release to use when checking compatibility.

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --vigilant 0.66" />

When a compatibility problem is found, the command fails with a non-zero exit
code, which causes the PR loop to fail. This protects the repo from risky
changes.

In the PR logs, you'll see a detailed report, in `diff` format, explaining what
went wrong.

```diff

error Changes are needed to satisfy all requirements. Re-run with `--write` to have dep-check apply them.
info Visit https://aka.ms/dep-check for more information about dep-check.
error Command failed with exit code 1.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

Fixing problems is automated, too! From your development terminal, run the same
command with a `--write` parameter.

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --vigilant 0.66 --write" />

**Review** and **test** the fixes before pushing them to your PR.

### Dependency Manager Updates

The dependency manager comes with a built-in list of known/good React Native
package versions and releases. Keeping the dependency manager up-to-date gives
you the latest compatibilty data.

If you are in GitHub, use
[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)
to keep your packages up-to-date, including the dependency manager. If you host
your repo elsewhere, you can use tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io) instead.

When a dependency manager update happens, the associated PR loop may fail with
incompatible package errors. This is OK. It means the built-in list of React
Native package versions has changed, and you need to update your packages in
response.

Run this command from the root of your repo. It uses the dependency manager to
make the fixes automatically.

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --write" />

**Review** and **test** the fixes before pushing them to the PR with the
dependency manager update.

## Upgrading React Native

When you're ready to upgrade to a new release of React Native (or downgrade to
an old release), you can use the dependency manager to help you out.

First, update your PR loop definition. Find the
`rnx-dep-check --vigilant [version]` command and change the target React Native
version.

Then, run these commands from the root of your repo to change your React Native
version and adjust all React Native dependencies to be compatible. Replace
`[version]` with your target React Native version in `major.minor` format, such
as "0.66" or "0.68".

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --set-version [version]" />

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --vigilant [version] --write" />

**Review** and **test** your packages thoroughly before merging these changes.

## Customization

Did you know that you can add your own packages to the dependency manager's
built-in list?

If your repo uses React Native packages that aren't known to the dependency
manager, add them to the list! Or if you want to align other dependencies
automatically, add them to the list too!

First, write the list of packages you want to manage. Each one is expressed as a
[capability](/docs/dependencies#capabilities-and-profiles). You can use a `.js`
module, a `.json` file, or a module name.

```json title="dependency-profile.json"
{
  "@types/node": {
    "name": "@types/node",
    "version": "^16.0.0",
    "devOnly": true
  },
  "chalk": {
    "name": "chalk",
    "version": "^4.1.0"
  },
  "0.63": {
    "native-base": {
      "name": "native-base",
      "version": "^3.3.11",
      "capabilities": ["react"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

Look at `native-base` in the example above. It's wrapped in a `0.63` version
tag. That means it only applies to React Native 0.63 and above.

:::

Next, configure each of your onboarded React Native packages to use the list.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "rnx-kit": {
    "customProfiles": "path/to/dependency-profile.json"
  }
}
```

Now its time to use the list. Run the dependency manager to update all of your
packages.

<PackageRunCommand args="rnx-dep-check --vigilant 0.66 --customProfiles path/to/dependency-profile.json --write" />

**Review** and **test** the changes before continuing.

The last step is updating the automation. Each command needs an extra
`--customProfiles [path]` parameter.

- Pull Requests: Change the `rnx-dep-check --vigilant [version]` command
- Dependency Manager Updates: Change the `rnx-dep-check --write` command
- Upgrading React Native: Change the
  `rnx-dep-check --vigilant [version] --write` command

## Finish Line

Congratulations! Your React Native apps and libraries are now up-to-date and
compatible with each other! And they should stay that way thanks to the
automation you've put in place!
