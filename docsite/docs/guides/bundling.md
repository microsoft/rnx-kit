# Bundling

:::danger Draft Content

This page needs to be converted from a draft to real instructions.

Guides should be step-by-step instructions. Devs use them to complete a task.
Doing, not learning. If you want to explain why, add notes to pages under "The
Basics" (or add a new page there).

:::

First step is to follow the
[Getting Started guide](/docs/guides/getting-started). dep-check onboarding, and
app packages get Metro/Babel setup.

## Application On-boarding

Configure app packages for bundling and serving.

CLI and custom integration -- Set up dup/cyclic dep checkers, type safety,
tree-shaking.

## Bundle an App

Show CLI commands to create bundles, per-platform. Link to CLI "tools" page.

Add commands to package.json script blocks and/or custom build system.

## Start an App Bundle Server

Show CLI commands to start a bundle server. Link to CLI "tools" page.

Add commands to package.json script blocks and/or custom build system.

## Continuous Validation

Add CLI commands to CI loops (PRs, builds).
