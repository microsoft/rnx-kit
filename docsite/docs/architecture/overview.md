# Architecture Overview

If you're here, it means you want to learn more about the tools themselves. You
want to understand **why**. What's going on inside of a particular tool? What
decisions led to that design?

Don't see the topic you're looking for? Do you have specific questions that
aren't answered here? Take a look at the [Resources](../resources) area. You'll
find talks, podcasts, recorded streaming sessions, and other materials that may
help you out. You'll also find links to the developer community where you can
ask questions and get help.
