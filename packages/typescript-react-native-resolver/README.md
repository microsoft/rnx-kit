`@rnx-kit/typescript-react-native-resolver` is a TypeScript module resolver for
use with react-native projects.

## ðŸ›‘ Deprecated ðŸ›‘

This tool has been deprecated in favor of using
`@rnx-kit/metro-plugin-typescript`, which is built on the `moduleSuffixes`
TypeScript
[compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleSuffixes).

You may continue to use it, but it will be removed in a future release.

## Synopsis

This resolver uses the target platform to find platform-override files such as
`foo.ios.ts` and `foo.native.ts`. It also maps `react-native` module references
to out-of-tree platforms such as `react-native-windows` and
`react-native-macos`. For performance reasons, these mappings are built into the
resolver, rather than loaded dynamically using `@react-native-community/cli`.
