This is a sample folder to use as base for generating new packages for
`rnx-kit`.

## Motivation

We want new packages to follow an existing set of patterns and guidelines; via
this package, we can enforce easily allow new folders to stick to at least a
common starting point.

## Usage

Simply run from rnx-kit root

```sh
yarn new-package newPackageName
```

To generate a sample project for you to use.

<!--
### What does every file do?

- `src` folder - the main folder in which you want to add files for your package
  - `index.ts` we mostly work with typescript, so we'd expect you to use the pattern of index.ts and export default methods
  - `types.ts` you should add the types for your code in dedicated files (when it starts to get massive)
- `test` folder - contains the tests that will be ran during `yarn test`
  - `index.test.ts` you usually want one test file per each file in the src folder
- `CHANGELOG.md` this will be generated by Changesets
- `just.config.js` sets up commands (or tasks as they are called) such as build, format, lint, and test. We use it to have a uniform way of building etc. across all packages.
- `package.json` classic package file describer - your main point of control. Remember to leverage the existing infra and practices!
- `README.md` what will tell your users everything they need to know. Please make sure to cover at least a few basics: how to use, which problems it solve, any specific props or patterns to follow. Your tests should help explain in details how the code actually works
- `tsconfig.json` standard TS configuration for your package - it should be fairly simple, as it leverages the monorepo shared configs.
