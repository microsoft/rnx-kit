This is a sample/template folder to use as base for generating new packages for
`rnx-kit`.

## Motivation

We tend to add new packages to the monorepo without any clear guidelines; this
wants to start introducing something in that direction.

## Usage

Copy/paste this folder and change all the relevant files to match your new
addition (so, change name of folder, in the package.json, etc).

It's not ideal but at least it's a start.

### What does every file do?

- `src` folder - contains two files bla bla bla
  - `index.ts` bla bla bla
  - `types.ts` bla bla bla
- `CHANGELOG.json` bla bla bla
- `CHANGELOG.md` bla bla bla
- `just.config.js` bla bla bla
- `package.json` bla bla bla
- `README.md` bla bla bla
- `tsconfig.json` bla bla bla
