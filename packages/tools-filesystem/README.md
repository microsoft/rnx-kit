`@rnx-kit/tools-filesystem` is a collection of commonly used functions for
manipulating the filesystem.

You can import the entire package, or, to save space, import individual
categories:

```typescript
import * as tools from "@rnx-kit/tools-filesystem";

// Alternatively...
import * as mocks from "@rnx-kit/tools-filesystem/mocks";
```

### Filesystem helpers

The bulk of this package contains a set of convenience wrappers for working with
the filesystem. This ensures people use the same constants when referencing
files, handle certain patterns like BOM stripping and new line appending for
JSON files correctly, and provides implementations for some more complex
patterns like file matching.

### MockFS submodule

This package has an export entry for mocking the filesystem for testing. This
uses `memfs` for its implementation. This is marked as an optional peer
dependency but it is required when using the `mockFS` convenience wrapper.

| compare  | `filesMatch(pathA, pathB)`             | Try to efficiently determine if two files match by size and content                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| compare  | `filesMatchSync(path1, path2)`         | Compare two files to determine if two files are identical in content. This means either the content matches or they are actually referencing the same file on disk (e.g. via a hardlink).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| compare  | `isSameFileFromStats(stats1, stats2)`  | Compares the stats of two files to determine if they refer to the same file. This preempts more expensive file comparisons by comparing the stats first. This will return: - true if the stats indicate the files are the same (e.g. same inode and device) - false if the stats indicate the files are different (e.g. different sizes) - undefined if the stats are inconclusive and further checks are needed (e.g. same size but different inodes) |
| dirs     | `ensureDir(path)`                      | Asynchronously ensures that a directory exists, creating it if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
