<p>Hi! <!-- -->👋<!-- --> Today, we are launching a new React Native Developer Tools
<strong>community</strong> project! <!-- -->🚀</p>
<p>These are <strong>modern</strong>, <strong>scalable tools</strong> focused on providing an <strong>exceptional
developer experience</strong>.</p>
<p>Our hope is that this project helps you build React Native apps, and that you'll
spread the word and share it with people you know! <code>#rnxkit</code></p>

<p>This project is purpose-built for React Native engineers. It is focused on
developer experience, and designed to fit into projects of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>We know that great tools make all the difference.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community-first">Community First<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community First" title="Direct link to Community First" href="https://microsoft.github.io/rnx-kit/blog/react-native-developer-tools#community-first">​</a></h2>
<p>We created this as a GitHub-first repository for the React Native community. The
tools in this project integrate with tools you already use: Metro, TypeScript,
Jest, and more.</p>
<p>Your contributions are always welcome! The more this project grows, the more it
will help the React Native community.</p>
<p>A rising tide lifts all boats.</p>

<p>From unit tests to deployments in large monorepos, each tool is thoroughly
validated. Microsoft has engineers dedicated to this project, using it to ship
React Native apps to millions of customers.</p>
<p>The tools here are used in Office, Xbox, Teams, and other product groups.</p>
