### Description

<!--
  Thank you for taking the time to file this issue.

  Please describe it in detail here:
  - What happened?
  - What did you expect to happen?
  - Can you attach build logs?
  - Can you attach screenshots?

  Please note that rnx-kit is still in the early stages of development.
  We are hard at work, adding new packages and features on a regular basis.
  We welcome your feedback in this bug report. Given our focus on building
  out the first "complete" version of @rnx-kit, supporting external users is
  not currently a high priority, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee prompt
  responses at this time.
