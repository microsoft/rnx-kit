### Description

<!--
  Thank you for taking the time to file this issue.

  Please describe it in detail here:
  - What happened?
  - What did you expect to happen?
  - Can you attach build logs?
  - Can you attach screenshots?

  Please note that support for using rnx-kit packages outside of
  Microsoft is still highly experimental. While we would be interested
  to hear feedback if you run into issues, supporting external users is
  not currently a high priority for the development team, so we
  unfortunately cannot guarantee prompt support at this time.
