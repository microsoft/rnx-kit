  "comment": "Separate Project methods into \"find\" and \"open\", allowing caller to decide on the appropriate error-handling logic. Add filtering when validating Project files -- 0nly include ts[x] unless checkJs is enabled. Make cache methods return a true/false result, moving error-handling up and out to the caller (Project). Stop converting to lowercase during path normalization, as this confuses typescript.",
