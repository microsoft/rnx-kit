  "comment": "Make `@react-native-community/cli-server-api` optional. We want to prevent cli from installing an extra copy, and also not require the user to explicitly add it to their dependencies. Since we're running inside `@react-native-community/cli`, it is reasonable to assume that this package will be installed. And if it isn't, we need to update our code anyway.",
