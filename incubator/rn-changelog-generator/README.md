This script used to live in
[react-native-community/releases](https://github.com/react-native-community/releases/blob/master/scripts/changelog-generator.ts),
and has moved here as part of deprecating that repo.

## Motivation

This script generates a markdown-formatted list of changes between two given
[git references](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References)
(e.g. tags).

The script is a little more complex than one might expect for the following
reasons:

- Attributing changes to the authorâ€™s github handle requires fetching the commit
  metadata from the github API, rather than relying on a local clone of the
  react-native repo.

- Due to how react-nativeâ€™s
  [release process](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/wiki/Release-Process)
  works, we want to be able to exclude previously cherry-picked commits from the
  changelog entry of the next version.

  However, with `git`, cherry-picked commits will have different commit hashes
  than their original counterparts â€“ as they exist in the `main` branch. Because
  of this, the next versionâ€™s stable branch will include the same changes,
  except using their _original_ commit hash. This makes it impossible to exclude
  these commits without further work.

  For this reason, the script will parse the â€˜referential revisionâ€™ â€“ which is
  added to each commit message by Facebookâ€™s infrastructure â€“ and use it to
  resolve to the original commit in the `main` branch. This resolved commitâ€™s
  hash is then used in the changelog entry, so the script can find and exclude
  it from the next versionâ€™s entry.

  This cannot be done via the github API and thus relies on a local clone of the
  react-native repo.

You can read more of the old documentation about it
[here](https://github.com/react-native-community/releases/blob/master/docs/generate-changelog.md).

## Setup

If you donâ€™t already have a checkout of the react-native repo in a nearby
folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/react-native.git
```

Ensure the repo is up-to-date:

```bash
pushd react-native
git checkout main
git pull
popd
```

## Usage

Generate a changelog for `react-native` commits between versions 0.65.0 and
0.66.0:

```sh
npx @rnx-kit/rn-changelog-generator --base v0.65.0 --compare v0.66.0 --repo ../../../react-native --changelog ../../../react-native/CHANGELOG.md
```

As explained above, you will need to have a local clone of `react-native`, which
is referenced by the `--repo` parameter.

### [Optional] Get a Github 'personal acccess token'

This script uses the Github API to fetch commit metadata. This data is
accessable without authentication as its public.

You can optionally provide a GitHub personal access token for the `--token`
parameter which may be necessary in case Github API rate-limits your requests.

Instructions to create a GitHub â€˜personal access tokenâ€™:

1. Visit the [token settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
1. Generate a new token and **only** give it the `public_repo` scope.
1. Store this token somewhere secure for future usage.
