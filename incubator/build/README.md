### Android: Install Android Studio

In order to launch the build artifact on device, you need to install Android
Studio. Once installed, go into **Preferences** ❭ **Appearance & Behavior** ❭
**System Settings** ❭ **Android SDK**, and install **Android SDK Build-Tools**
and **Android SDK Platform-Tools**.

If you want to run apps on the Android Emulator, follow the instructions here:
[Run apps on the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

### iOS: Install Signing Certificate and Provisioning Profile

In order to launch the build artifact on device, you need to install Apple
signing certificate and provisioning profile on your host of choice.

For GitHub, please follow the steps to create the four secrets here:
[Creating secrets for your certificate and provisioning profile](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-xcode-applications/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development#creating-secrets-for-your-certificate-and-provisioning-profile)
