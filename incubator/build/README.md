### This tool is EXPERIMENTAL - USE WITH CAUTION

ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

An experimental tool for building your native apps in the cloud.

## Requirements

ðŸš§ TODO: Reduce the number of requirements

- GitHub hosted repository
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) LTS 14.15 or greater
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Usage

ðŸš§ TODO: Not quite ready for general consumption

At the moment, running these two commands should trigger an iOS build, install
it in a simulator, and launch the app.

```sh
yarn build
yarn rnx-build
```
