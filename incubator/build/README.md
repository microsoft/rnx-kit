1. Requires [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Requires [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Usage

```sh
npm run rnx-build --platform <platform>
```

### `-p`, `--platform`

Target platform to build for.

Supported platforms are `android`, `ios`, `macos`, `windows`.

### `--deploy` (optional)

Where builds should be deployed from. For how to configure your app distribution
service, please see [Distribution](#distribution).

Supported deployment methods are `autodetect`, `local`.

Defaults to `autodetect`.

### `--device-type` (optional)

Target device type. This is currently only implemented for iOS.

Supported device types are `device`, `emulator`, `simulator`.

Specifying `emulator`/`simulator` implies `--distribution local`.

Defaults to `simulator`.

### `--package-manager` (optional)

Binary name of the package manager used in the current repo.

Defaults to `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn` if detected.

### `--project-root` (optional)

Path to the root of the project.

Defaults to current working directory.

### `--scheme` (optional)

The workspace scheme to build (iOS and macOS only).

Defaults to `ReactTestApp`.

## Distribution

### Android: Local Deployment

In order to launch the build artifact on device, you need to install Android
Studio. Once installed, go into **Preferences** ❭ **Appearance & Behavior** ❭
**System Settings** ❭ **Android SDK**, and install **Android SDK Build-Tools**
and **Android SDK Platform-Tools**.

If you want to run apps on the Android Emulator, follow the instructions here:
[Run apps on the Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).

### iOS: Install Signing Certificate and Provisioning Profile

In order to launch the build artifact on device, you need to install Apple
signing certificate and provisioning profile on your host of choice.

For GitHub, please follow the steps to create the four secrets here:
[Creating secrets for your certificate and provisioning profile](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-xcode-applications/installing-an-apple-certificate-on-macos-runners-for-xcode-development#creating-secrets-for-your-certificate-and-provisioning-profile)

### Firebase App Distribution

You can configure Firebase App Distribution by adding an
`rnx-kit.build.distribution` section in `package.json` like in the following
example:

```json
{
  ...
  "rnx-kit": {
    "build": {
      "distribution": {
        "service": "firebase",
        "appId": {
          "android": "1:1234567890:android:0a1b2c3d4e5f67890",
          "ios": "1:1234567890:android:0a1b2c3d4e5f67890"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next, you need to
[generate a token for Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/#cli-ci-systems),
and store it as a secret, `FIREBASE_TOKEN`, on your project host.

If you're using GitHub, you should store it as an encrypted secret:
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets

## Assumptions

### Folder Structure

Workflows currently assume that your project has a folder structure similar to
the one generated by `react-native init`, e.g.:

    app
    ├── android
    │   ├── gradlew
    │   └── gradlew.bat
    ├── ios
    │   └── Podfile
    ├── macos
    │   └── Podfile
    ├── windows
    │   └── App.sln
    ├── package.json
    └── src
