A package that helps with building typescript, particularly for react-native. It
leverages the @rnx-kit/typescript-service package to build using the language
service rather than using the compiler directly. This allows for custom
resolution strategies (among other things). The compilation and type-checking
are still done by typescript but this drives some convenient custom
configurations.

In particular the `buildTypeScript` command can do things like:

- multiplex a build in a directory, to build for multiple react-native platforms
  at the same time. The files will be split such that the minimal build can be
  performed.
- detect which react-native platforms should be built based on rnx-kit bundle
  configs or react-native.config.js settings.
- successfully build with the module suffixes without throwing up a ton of bogus
  unresolved reference errors.
- share caches where possible to speed up compilations within the same node
  process.

## Motivation

The current story for building typescript for react-native is sub-par, and
typescript itself is particularly restrictive with module resolution. This
addresses the ability to build react-native better right now, but also creates a
framework for experimenting with different resolvers.

## Things to do

- Look at watch mode behavior, add invalidation for caching layers
- Look at routing host creation in metro-plugin-typescript through here
- Evaluate alternative resolvers

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @rnx-kit/tools-typescript --dev
```

or if you're using npm

```sh
npm add --save-dev @rnx-kit/tools-typescript
```

| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| types    | AsyncThrottler | Interface for capping the max number of async operations that happen at any given time. This allows for multiple AsyncWriter instances to be used in parallel while still limiting the max number of concurrent operations |
| types    | AsyncWriter    | Interface for handling async file writing. There is a synchronous write function then a finish function that will wait for all writes to complete                                                                          |
