### Context

This tool is an updated & cleaned up version of
https://github.com/mganandraj/office-android-patches. This tool was created a
few years ago, heavily inspired by
[`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) but repurposed to be
used locally within the `react-native-macos`.

There are two core ideas in this tool:

1. you can do some local changes, even across multiple files, then you can save
   them up in a patch folder for future usage. (via `diff`)
2. you can reapply all the patch folders that you want via a separate command
   (via `patch`)

You can find more details about how it's used by `react-native-macos`
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/tree/main/android-patches).

## Usage

This tool has mainly two commands, `diff` and `patch`. You can find the full
list of functionalities by invoking the command
`npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos --help`.

The commands have an option `--log-folder` that allows the user to point a
folder in which a set of files with different levels of logging will be stored.
According to each level of gravity, the files are going to be `error.log`,
`all.log`, `warn.log`, and `exceptions.log`.

### `diff`

This command will take a folder and a "clean-copy" of it _(that needs to be
separate)_ to generate a set of patch files that can be applied. The idea is to
be able to re-apply the changes programmatically via the other command, `patch`.

When using this command, you will need to pass a series of parameters to ensure
it's successful:

```sh
npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos diff <path-of-folder> <path-of-clean-copy-folder> --patch-name <name-for-patch-folder>
```

Along with these core options, you might want to pass the following params:

- `--inclusion-list-dirs`, relative path within the folder with the changes to
  focus on (instead of having the tool look everywhere inside it)
- `--log-folder`, path in which to store logs of the execution of this command
- `--git-executable` and `--diff-executable`, these by default try to find the
  Git tool in Windows. So, if you are in a Unix-based solution like macos, you
  will want to pass something like
  `--git-executable /usr/local/bin/git --diff-executable /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.34.0/libexec/git-core/git-diff`

A complete example of this script on macos is the following:

```sh
npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos diff ../../../react-native-macos-main/ ../../../react-native-macos-clean-copy --inclusion-list-dirs ./ReactAndroid --patch-name TEST --log-folder ./logs --git-executable /usr/local/bin/git --diff-executable /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.34.0/libexec/git-core/git-diff
```

A more complete explanation of all the params can be found via
`npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos diff --help`.

### **`patch`**

This command allows to apply to the codebase all the various folder patches (via
their names) - like so:

```sh
npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos patch <path-of-codebase> <array-of-patches-folder-names> --patch-store <path-of-folder-containing-patches> --log-folder <path-to-folder-where-to-store-logs> --confirm true
```

The `--confirm true` param at the end is necessary to allow the tool write the
changes.

A complete example of this script on macos is the following:

```sh
npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos patch ../../../react-native-macos-main Build OfficeRNHost V8 Focus MAC ImageColor --patch-store ../../../react-native-macos-main/android-patches/patches --log-folder ../../../react-native-macos-main/android-patches/logs --confirm true
```

A more complete explanation of all the params can be found via
`npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos patch --help`.

### **`patchfile`**

This command is similar to `patch`, but targets a specific file:

```
patchfile [options] <targetFilePath> <patchFilePath>
```

A more complete explanation of all the params can be found via
`npx @rnx-kit/patcher-rnmacos patchfile --help`.
